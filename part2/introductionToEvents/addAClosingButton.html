      Horse
    </h3>
    <p>The horse is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the
      taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed
      creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.</p>

    <h3>
      Cat
    </h3>
    <p>The domestic cat (Latin: Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called
      house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and
      felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.
